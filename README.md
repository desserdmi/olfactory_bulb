## Summary
 This is a collaboration project between  the Interdisciplinary Center "Smell & Taste" Dresden, Germany and Center for Music in the Brain Aarhus, Denmark.

Disturbances of smell and taste are common. About 5% of the general population have anosmia (absence of the sense of smell). Olfactory dysfunction can markedly impair the quality of life.

Olfactory and emotional higher processing pathways share common anatomical substrates. Hence, depression is often accompanied by alterations in olfactory function. These alterations are negative in nature and may involve decreased activation in olfactory eloquent structures or decreased volume in the olfactory bulb (OB).

Furthermore, anosmia is a common non-motor feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). The  [olfactory tract](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/olfactory-tract "Learn more about Olfactory Tract from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")  is involved early in PD as indicated by frequent occurrence of [hyposmia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/hyposmia "Learn more about Hyposmia from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") or anosmia years or decades before motor symptoms and by autopsy studies showing early  [synuclein](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/synuclein "Learn more about Synuclein from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")  pathology in the olfactory tract and [anterior olfactory nucleus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/anterior-olfactory-nucleus "Learn more about Anterior Olfactory Nucleus from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") even in the early stages of PD. Testing for  [olfaction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/olfaction "Learn more about Olfaction from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") consists of evaluation of olfactory thresholds, smell identification and discrimination, and  [olfactory memory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/olfactory-memory "Learn more about Olfactory Memory from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").

### Aims

 - develop a CNN for automated segmentation of bulbus olfactorius based on T2 - MRI scans
 - develop a machine-learning algorithm for prediction of Anosmia/Dysosmia and associated diseases  (e.g. Major Depression, Parkinson's disease) based on clinical parameters like volume/shape of bulbus olfactorius, symptoms duration, TDI,  age or gender.
