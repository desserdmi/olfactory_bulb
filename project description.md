## Summary
 This is a collaboration project between  the Interdisciplinary Center "Smell & Taste" Dresden, Germany and Center for Music in the Brain Aarhus, Denmark.

Disturbances of smell and taste are common. About 5% of the general population have anosmia (absence of the sense of smell). Olfactory dysfunction can markedly impair the quality of life. 
Furthermore, anosmia is a common non-motor feature of Parkinson's disease (PD).

### Aims

 - develop a CNN for automated segmentation of bulbus olfactorius based on T2 - MRI scans
 - develop a machine-learning algorithm for prediction of Anosmia/Dysosmia and associated diseases  (e.g. Major Depression, Parkinson's disease) based on clinical parameters like volume/shape of bulbus olfactorius, symptoms duration, TDI,  age or gender.
